Introdction
===========
MultiLife is a multi-species variant of Conway's Game of Life. By
"multi-species," we mean that there is more than one set of rules governing
the behavior of each type of life.

Background
==========
In Conway's Game of Life, there is a rectangular array of holes, each of
which is either populated or isn't. A turn-based algorithm (simulating
"generations") treats each hole as a "center" and examines the 8 surrounding
holes. The agorithm works as follows:

  * If center is populated:
    - If adjacent count < 2, center = unpopulated.
    - If adjacent count > 3, center = unpopulated.
    - else center = populated.
  * If center is unpopulated:
    - If adjacent count = 3, center = populated.
    - else center = unpopulated.
